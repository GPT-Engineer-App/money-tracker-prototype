# money-tracker-prototype

Create a prototype of an PFM app that supports *ALL*  the following uses stories:

User Story: Add Transaction

As a user, I want to add a new transaction with details such as date, amount, type (income/expense), and category, so that I can keep track of my financial activities.
User Story: View Transactions

As a user, I want to view a list of my transactions, showing details like date, amount, type, and category, so that I can quickly review my financial activities.

User Story: Edit Transaction

As a user, I want to edit an existing transaction's details in case I made an error or an update is needed, so that my transaction records are accurate.

User Story: Delete Transaction

As a user, I want to delete a transaction if it was added by mistake or is no longer relevant, so that my financial records are up to date.

User Story: Filter Transactions

As a user, I want to filter transactions based on type (income/expense), category, or date range, so that I can find specific transactions or analyze my finances over a certain period.

User Story: Calculate Total Balance

As a user, I want to see my total balance, calculated as the sum of all income minus the sum of all expenses, so that I can have a quick overview of my financial health.

User Story: Categorize Transactions

As a user, I want to categorize transactions (e.g., groceries, bills, salary) so that I can organize my finances and better understand where my money is going.

User Story: Export Transactions

As a user, I want to export my transactions to a file (e.g, JSON) that I can save to my device, so that I can keep a backup or use the data in other applications.

*Important*

This is a prototype but please sure you implement ALL the user stories, mocking and using dummy data if necesary. We will validate the prototype by running through EVERY SINGLE user story, so we need to be able to complete every single task.
